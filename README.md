# CapitalCart.pk — Islamabad’s Smart Shopping Destination

A full-featured e-commerce web application built with Laravel 12 and Livewire 4. CapitalCart.pk covers everything you'd expect from a modern online store — product browsing, variant selection, a session-based cart, PKR currency, WhatsApp ordering, order management, wishlists, coupon codes, and a complete admin panel — all without a single page reload thanks to Livewire's reactive components.

## What's inside

This project started as a way to build a clean, maintainable e-commerce foundation using Laravel's latest conventions. Instead of reaching for a pre-built package, everything here is hand-crafted — the cart logic, the checkout flow, the admin panel, the variant system. That means you can read and understand every piece of it.

**The storefront** gives customers a filterable product catalog, full product detail pages with image galleries and reviews, a slide-out cart sidebar, and a three-step checkout that handles Stripe card payments, cash on delivery, and bank transfer in the same flow.

**The admin panel** lives under `/admin` and lets you manage products (including variable products with size/colour/etc. variants), track and update orders, manage categories, create discount coupons, moderate reviews, and manage user accounts.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- SQLite (built into PHP — no setup needed)

### Installation

**1. Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/capitalcart.git
cd capitalcart
```

**2. One-command setup**

```bash
composer run setup
```

This single command installs PHP dependencies, copies `.env.example` to `.env`, generates your app key, runs all migrations, installs npm packages, and builds the frontend assets.

**3. Seed the database**

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

This creates sample categories, products with variants and images, coupon codes, reviews, and user accounts (see the [Default accounts](#default-accounts) section below).

**4. Start the development server**

```bash
composer run dev
```

This starts everything you need in parallel: the Laravel dev server on port 8003, the queue worker, log tailing with Pail, and Vite's hot-reload dev server.

Open **http://localhost:8003** in your browser.

---

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values you need. The defaults work out of the box for local development with SQLite.

```env
APP_NAME=CapitalCart.pk
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Database — SQLite by default, no configuration needed
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite

# Stripe — required for card payments
# Get your keys from https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
STRIPE_KEY=pk_test_...          # publishable key  (starts with pk_)
STRIPE_SECRET=sk_test_...       # secret key       (starts with sk_)
VITE_STRIPE_KEY="${STRIPE_KEY}" # exposes the publishable key to the browser
```

> **Important:** `STRIPE_KEY` must be your **publishable** key (starts with `pk_test_`). `STRIPE_SECRET` must be your **secret** key (starts with `sk_test_`). Never swap these around — the app will warn you in the browser console if you get it wrong.

---

## Default accounts

After running `php artisan db:seed`, the following accounts are ready to use.

### Admin accounts

| Name      | Email                   | Password              |
| --------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |

| Nasir Ali | nasir@capitalcart.pk    | `NasirAli@123`        |

Log in at `/login` and you'll be redirected to `/admin/dashboard` automatically.

### Customer accounts

All dummy customers use the password `password`.

| Name          | Email             |

## Testing Stripe payments

Use Stripe's test card numbers in the checkout. No real money is involved.

| Scenario           | Card number           | Expiry          | CVC          |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Successful payment | `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Any future date | Any 3 digits |
| Card declined      | `4000 0000 0000 0002` | Any future date | Any 3 digits |
| Requires 3D Secure | `4000 0025 0000 3155` | Any future date | Any 3 digits |

---

## Database schema

The database has 16 tables covering the full e-commerce domain.

```
users                        — customers and admin accounts (is_admin flag)
categories                   — product categories with slugs and sort order
products                     — main product table (supports simple & variable)
product_images               — multiple images per product with sort order
attribute_types              — e.g. "Size", "Colour", "Material"
attributes                   — e.g. "Large", "Red", with optional colour hex
product_variants             — a specific combination of attributes on a product
product_variant_attributes   — pivot: which attributes belong to which variant
orders                       — order header with billing, shipping, payment info
order_items                  — individual line items per order
coupons                      — discount codes (percentage or fixed amount)
reviews                      — customer reviews with approval workflow
wishlists                    — saved products per user
cache                        — Laravel cache table storage
sessions                     — database session storage
jobs                         — queue job storage
```

## How the cart works

The cart is entirely session-based — no database table required, no login needed. `CartService` stores a structured array in the session under the key `capitalcart_cart`.

Each item is keyed by `{product_id}-{variant_id}` so the same product in different sizes or colours is tracked as separate line items. The service handles subtotals, coupon discounts, shipping (free over $50, otherwise $5.99), and 8% tax. When the customer places an order, `OrderService` reads from `CartService`, writes the `Order` and `OrderItem` records, and clears the cart.

---

## How Stripe works

Card details never touch your server. The flow is:

1. Customer reaches step 3 (Review). Stripe's card element mounts in the browser via Stripe.js.
2. Customer clicks **Pay**. The browser calls `createPaymentIntent` on the Livewire component.
3. The server creates a `PaymentIntent` via the Stripe API and returns a `client_secret`.
4. Stripe.js calls `confirmCardPayment()` in the browser using the client secret and the mounted card element.
5. On success, the browser calls `finalizeStripeOrder()` with the `paymentIntent.id`.
6. The server retrieves the PaymentIntent from Stripe, verifies its status is `succeeded`, then creates the order.

---

## Variable products

Products can be simple (one price, one stock count) or variable (multiple variants with individual prices and stock levels).

Variable products use a flexible attribute system. You define `AttributeType` records like "Size" or "Colour", then `Attribute` records like "Small / Medium / Large" or "Red / Blue / Green". A `ProductVariant` is then a specific combination of those attributes linked through the `product_variant_attributes` pivot table.

> **Note for contributors:** The relationship on `ProductVariant` is named `variantAttributes()`, not `attributes()`. This is intentional — Eloquent uses `$this->attributes` internally to store its raw data array, so naming a relationship `attributes()` causes a fatal conflict that produces `Call to a member function map() on array`. Keep it as `variantAttributes()` everywhere and update any eager loads accordingly.

## Useful commands

```bash
# Full setup from scratch
composer run setup
php artisan db:seed

# Start development (server + queue + logs + vite, all at once)
composer run dev

# Re-seed without dropping tables (safe to run multiple times)
php artisan db:seed

# Fresh database + seed (wipes everything)
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Seed only users
php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder

# Build frontend for production
npm run build

# Run tests
composer run test

# Interactive console
php artisan tinker
```

## What's not included yet

A few things you'd want before going to production:

- **Email notifications** — the mail driver is set to `log` by default. Configure SMTP or a service like Resend/Postmark to send real order confirmation emails.
- **File uploads** — the product image system stores URLs. You'd want to add actual file upload handling (Laravel's filesystem + S3 or similar).
- **Stripe webhooks** — there's no webhook endpoint. For production you'd want to handle `payment_intent.succeeded` and `payment_intent.payment_failed` to keep order status reliable even if the browser closes.
- **Better search** — the current search is a simple `LIKE` query. For a larger catalog, Laravel Scout with MeiliSearch or Typesense would be a better fit.
- **Feature tests** — PHPUnit is set up but the test suite is empty. A good starting point would be tests for the CartService and the checkout flow.
